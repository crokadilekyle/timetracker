<p>If you're like me I lose track of time ALL THE TIME.  I start coding and next thing I know it's 1:00am and I should have been asleep hours ago.</p>
<p>This is why I decided to build this time tracker.  It is a simple time tracking app built with Javascript so I can keep tabs on how long I am working on things.  It uses the browser's local storage to save my data so no database required!</p>
<p>Basically the way it works is you add a 'code' for each project that you want to track your time on.  Then you simply clock into the code when you start working on the project and punch out when your done.</p>
